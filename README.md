# **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions**

## **Overview**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It uses supervised learning techniques and a public dataset containing anonymized transaction records. The objective is to help identify fraud effectively by analyzing various features of financial transactions.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and understand the dataset using statistical and visual methods.
- **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure model performance.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used is the **[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)** from Kaggle. It contains anonymized transaction data with the following attributes:
- `Time`: Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- `Amount`: Transaction amount.
- `Class`: Target variable (1 indicates fraud, 0 indicates non-fraud).

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` for data manipulation
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection-project
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Loading**:
   Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**:
   Train a Random Forest classifier using the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
5. **Visualization**:
   Create visualizations to understand class distribution and model predictions.

---

## **How to Run**
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or VS Code).
2. Run each code cell or script in the order specified in the notebook/script.
3. View the evaluation metrics and visualizations to understand the model's performance.

---

## **Results**
- The trained model achieves high precision and recall for fraud detection.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
- Integrate textual features (if available) using NLP techniques.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time fraud detection.
